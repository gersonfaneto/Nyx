;; NOTE 2024-02-17: Some cons cells here have a symbol as a `cdr' and
;; some do not.  The former are those which define a prefix command
;; (per `define-prefix-command').  This is a symbol that references
;; the keymaps, thus making our binding an indirection: if we update
;; the key map, we automatically get the new key bindings.  Whereas
;; when we bind a key to the value of a variable, we have to update
;; the key map and then the binding for changes to propagate.
